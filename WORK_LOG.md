For most of this time, I think my brain was just trying to wrap itself around the idea of the problem in that it could skip over temperatures but not go back, so I wa skind of testing cases out in my head to see what scenarios which would be the longest run, because I got cnfused for a sec in the order of things and if it would be possible for a cetain run that jumps to a different temperature to actually be more efficient. This confused me for a while, but eventually I think I figured it out in my head, so I was able to start actually formulating a plan in my head for the solution, but I was mainly just thinking of the brute force way of just checking all the paths which would be incredibly slow. |
| Jan 13  | 9:30-10:30pm | I think after thinking throuhg the problem eysterday, I had a lot clearer idea of what the problem actually consistd of, so I spent this time thinking out my approach and writing really rough psuedocode and a little code in the time I had. The approach I was thinking of was creating an array where the longest trend was ended at day i of the array and that if each single day would be a length of 1, then for each index i, you could look at the previous days and compare whether it was less than or greater than, and if the temperature next is greater than, then you increase the trend count by 1. I wrote out psuedocode for this, but I kind of knew that I was slightly off in my aproach because once you return the maximum value of the trend, it would have a runtime of like n^2 roughly, so I knew that once it was revealed in class I would probably have to change my approach, but I thought I got thinking pretty well and actual wrote some rough code that maybe could be used once he reveals the proper approach. |

This was an interesting approach which might've had something to do with what I was talking aout earlier, but not quite, so I'd have to reset my code, which was fine because tis way actually made sense to me practically. I spent this time talking through with my groupmates and mr. blick about how this made sense and options to implement it, but we didn't really get anywhere, although the problemset did make sense to me. |

I wrote out some rough psuedocode for this, but I spent most of the time trying to think out how I would implement such a graph efficiently, espescially considering how there would be so many entries that its just not practical to be going and comparing each trend. I did think the idea of the graphs made a lot of sense mentally in my head, but I was having trouble trying to figure out how I wanted to code it, so I just tried to write rough psuedocode for now. I like this idea and I am lookign forward to seeing what I can do with the rest of the problemset. |

Honestly felt like it all made a lot of sense to me, except for the adjacency list vs matrix part about it because I was slightly confused about the differences, but that wasn't encessarily that important to being able tos olve it, so I started to plan my appraoch. Honestly it seemed really short and straight forward by solving it recursively, so that's what I tried to do first. I jsut wrote out my thinking on this night so that when I was explained the theory a bit more in calss, I'd be able to solve it pretty easily recursively. |

The differences were intersting to hear, but honestly, I think that I was already on the right track at home. I spent the rest of this time starting to code and talking to my classmates about their approaches. Everyobne at my group had the idea of solving it recursively, and by the sounds of it, there weren't many diffferences in our intiial thinking to our appraoches, so I'm itnereested to see how all this turns out. It seemed extremely short and straightforward to me, so I thought I had the correct appraoch, just because of how efficient it seemed to me. I started coding my first main function, and that went pretty smoothly in the time that we had. |

I just felt like the recursive appproach just made so much sense ot me. With saving the data such that you don't have to go throuhg each path again, my approach felt really efficient and starightforward, and I honestly had no problems implementing it. At first I forgot the +1, but I was able to recognize that obvious mistake instantly, and it was able to work in pretty much my 2nd or 3rd attempt which was really nice to see. I went throuhg and cleaned up my code and added comments, but this was honestly a really short and sweet answer. |
